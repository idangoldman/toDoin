            <li>
                <strong>New Todo</strong>
                <p>"What's Next" strip is where you write new todos and submit them by clicking on the ENTER key.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Edit Todo</strong>
                <p>Pick a todo you want to edit and double click on it. It will show up in the "What's Next" strip in editing mode.</p>
                <p>Hitting the ESC will cancel changes</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Sort Todos</strong>
                <p>Pick any todo you want click on it and drag it to his new location</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Complete a Todo</strong>
                <p>Complete a todo my clicking on the "check" icon on the right of todo's text. The check icon turned green? congrats you have completed a todo.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Private Todo</strong>
                <p>If you click on the glasses, they will turn into sunglasses. Which means your todo will be private (blurred out on the screen).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Parsing Links and Email addresses</strong>
                <p>Seems to be a simple feature which stayed behind for too long. Now all http://blah.co.il and www.blah.co.il links are parse to blah.co.il and idan@blah.co.il email parsed to @idan.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Clear Todos from list</strong>
                <p>After completing a todo or two a "Eat a X" button will show click on it :)</p>
                <p>This feature got some people confuse, but I still don't want to change it back to "delete completed todos". So any other encouraging activity suggestion to what you want to do after completing a todo will be welcomed.</p>
